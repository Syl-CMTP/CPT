# Natura Prima
This game is an educational text adventure game about reviving a dead ecosystem. The player will learn the intricacies of reviving an ecosystem through a variety of different treatment options and the outcome those choices will follow.


Limitations
1. It's possible for the player not being able to get a certain ending simply due to bad RNG.
2. Could not do as much indepth research about the effects of treatments as I wanted, so they may be inaccurate.
3. The costs were fictional and do not reflect actual cost of treatment.
4. The choice of treatments and order of choice does not affect the score of future treatments like I originally wanted.
